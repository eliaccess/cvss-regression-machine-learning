# Machine Learning for CVSS prediction

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in this repository, because it had to be cleaned to be usable. That is why "cve.csv" is available at the root of the project.

## Needs

This project comes from an issue : it is important in some fields (here for autonomous trains) to evaluate the danger of a cyber attack, to sort their correction priority. Therefore, the CVSS, which goes from 0 to 10, evaluates this criticity. Using Machine Learning to evaluate this risk might be a good solution to make it quicker based on the stack and other information. In this Notebook, we will try this solution, using the regressive approach.
